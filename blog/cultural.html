        <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2>

        <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>

        <p>I think while I was reading (chapter 3 of <i>Search Inside Yourself</i>) about the mindful conversation techniques I didn't really see the value in it, but after putting it into practice I actually found it quite useful. The topic we chose for the conversation was 'your self-assessment: what you like, what you want to change, and where you want to be in the future'. Both me and my conversation partner were surprised at how refreshing it was to assess ourselves introspectively and articulate what we were thinking into spoken words. We also learned a lot about each other as we both shared ideas that normally keep to ourselves as an internal monologue.</p>

        <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>

        <p>I quite liked the concept of Joyful Mindfulness, which is practicing mindfulness using joy as the focus of your meditation. I understood this as taking the time to enjoy, pause, and reflect on any good experiences that arise. By being mindful in joyful experiences they become more enjoyable as you are more present to enjoy them.</p>

        <h2>Meditation Process</h2>

        <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>

        <p>I think when I began the site rebuild I wasn't keeping the concept of 'process over product' in mind. I was more concerned with getting my website as close to the wireframes as possible, which was extremely challenging and frustrating. After realising that the purpose of the exercise was to learn how to create a responsive website using Skeleton, I decided to start from scratch and focus more on the process itself, rather than the final product, and was surprised at how much progress I made over a short time.</p>

        <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>

        <p>I didn't really know too much about meditation before reading chapter 2 of <i>Search inside Yourself</i>. My only understanding of it was from the way meditation is represented in film and television. I had heard of the analogy that meditation is like exercise for your brain, though.</p>

        <h4>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h4>

        <p>I think the scientific evidence of the benefits were pretty interesting. I was surprised by the study the author cited that showed how meditation can improve an individual's immune function by increasing their ability to produce antibodies to the flu vaccine, and another study which showed that meditation helped accelerate treatment against psoriasis.</p>

        <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>

        <p>What stood out to me was that there is no 'right' way to meditate, and that it entirely depends on what works for you. Previously, my understanding was that the traditional 'seven-point' meditation posture is the proper way, but you can actually experiment with different postures and with your eyes open or closed.</p>

        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

        <p>In preparation for this cultural reflection, I read the first chapter of Google's <i>Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace)</i> by Chade-Meng Tan, and had a go at practicing mindfulness for two minutes.</p>

        <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>

        <p>I was a little bit familiar with the book already, after seeing a short lecture on emotional intelligence at EDA's 'Day in the Life' open day. I think what I found most interesting was the link between our psychological and physiological well-being. Our emotions are correlated with different parts of the body, and changes in our emotions result in bodily changes too. Therefore, by enhancing our perceptibility to emotional changes, we are able to better control our physiological well-being. It seems obvious reading about it now, but it's something I hadn't actively thought about before.</p>

        <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>

        <p>I found it quite difficult to make such a sudden shift from 'doing' to 'being'. It's something that becomes easier the more you practice it, I suppose. Shifting your focus back onto your breathing helps when you find your mind wandering. When the two minutes were up, I came out feeling like I was 'gone' for longer than two minutes and felt a little bit disorientated! But it felt good to clear my head a bit and I'll definitely try practicing mindfulness on a more regular basis.</p>

        <h2>Shereef's Fireside Chat Reflection</h2>

        <h4>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h4>

        <p>I view EDA as a course that challenges more traditional teaching and learning philosophies where, instead of simply being told what to learn and do, students are encouraged to take control of what/how they learn the material.</p>

        <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>

        <p>My initial impressions are really positive! So far, my learning has been really practical and 'hands-on'. I am able learn the material at a speed at which I am comfortable, using the helpful resources provided by EDA as well as other resources I have found independently.</p>

        <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>

        <p>Really well, I hope! Part of what attracted me to EDA was their focus on teaching soft skills, as well as allowing students the freedom to learn the material in a way that best suits their learning style. I see a lot of similarities between the way EDA is structured and the Montessori teaching pedagogy (which I am very familiar with as a former Montessori student). I see myself engaging the EDA culture really well, and look forward to what the next 18 weeks will bring!</p>

        <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>

        <p>My expectations have definitely changed a little bit now that we have actually started. I was initially concerned that I might struggle to keep up with the material and was worried that it might be too technical for me to grasp. But the so far the way the course has been structured (with a number of assignments and smaller sub-tasks within the assignments) has meant that even if I might not complete a task in one sitting, I can still walk away feeling like I've accomplished something. It's also comforting to know that everyone else in my cohort is in the same boat as me, so if I'm struggling with something, chances are that someone else is struggling with it too.</p>

        <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>

        <p>As I mentioned before, I was intially pretty nervous about what to expect, but now that we have actually gotten stuck into it a little bit my nerves have setttled a bit!</p>

        <h2>Time and Habits</h2>

        <p>After reading through the resources on time management and developing good habits, I found the blog post on <a href="https://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/" target="_blank">counterintuitive ways to be productive</a> really interesting because of how much it challenged my understanding of what it means to be 'productive'. I always considered productivity to mean being able to accomplish a lot of tasks in any given day, but the post describes it more as a state of mental well-being. In other words, the work we do is only productive if it is meaningful to us and makes us feel good at the end of the day. I also like that the author writes about how the things that we do aren't always productive, but that doesn't mean they're not important</p>

        <p>Although in the past I haven't really consciously thought about what techniques I use to be productive, I can see some parallels between what I just read about time & habits and what has worked for me in the past when working on a project. For example, <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/make-it-big-by-starting-small" target="_blank">starting small</a> is a technique that I have used subconsciously when working on big projects like university assignments. I find that the task doesn't seem as dauting when you're only looking at small pieces at a time. However, it can be easy to put too much energy into one small part if you have a good <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-best-tricks-for-getting-in-the-zone-at-work" target="_blank">flow</a> going. I believe this is where timeboxing comes into play.</p>

        <p>I see myself working on integrating <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/timebox.html" target="_blank">timeboxing</a> techniques into my work habits, as this will allow me to focus and, more importantly, de-focus on tasks in a more evenly distributed way. Toggl, the time-tracking tool used at EDA, has an in-built pomodoro timer feature which I will try out to see if it works for me. I also anticipate that myself and the teams I work with will be using the concept of <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html" target="_blank">Minimum Viable Product</a> a lot throughout our EDA journey.</p>
