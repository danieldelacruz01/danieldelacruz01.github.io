      <h4>HTML, CSS, and the DOM: A non-technical analogy</h4>

      <p>I'm still trying to get my head around the concept of the DOM (Direct Object Model) and how it relates to HTML and CSS. If my understanding is correct, I think the different elements of a short story might make a good analogy for how they interrelate:</p>
      <p>HTML elements are like the subjects and objects in a short story (i.e. all the nouns). Without them the story doesn't really exist.</p>
      <p>CSS can be likened to the descriptive words used (i.e. adjectives, adverbs) to give the story character and bring it to life.</p>
      <p>(If I understood correctly) the DOM is kind of like the reader's understanding of language. Much like how we use our knowledge to determine which words are subjects/objects, and which are decriptive words, our web browsers use the DOM read and interpret nodes on a webpage.</p>

      <h4>What is boxifying design?</h4>

      <p>Boxifying design is the process of taking a design mockup and creating a very basic 'wireframe' of the webpage layout by physically or mentally drawing boxes around the different elements & sections of the page.</p>

      <h4>What is the Box Model?</h4>

      <p>The box model is a design rule that describes each element of a webpage as a box (regardless of its actual shape). The box is made up of several visible and invisible layers; the margin, the border, the padding, and the content itself.</p>
