      <h3>C2 Emotional Intelligence reflection</h3>

      <br>

      <p>In preparation for this cultural reflection, I read the first chapter of Google's <i>Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace)</i> by Chade-Meng Tan, and had a go at practicing mindfulness for two minutes.</p>

      <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>

      <p>I was a little bit familiar with the book already, after seeing a short lecture on emotional intelligence at EDA's 'Day in the Life' open day. I think what I found most interesting was the link between our psychological and physiological well-being. Our emotions are correlated with different parts of the body, and changes in our emotions result in bodily changes too. Therefore, by enhancing our perceptibility to emotional changes, we are able to better control our physiological well-being. It seems obvious reading about it now, but it's something I hadn't actively thought about before.</p>

      <h4>How did you find the two minutes of minfulness?</h4>

      <p>I found it quite difficult to make such a sudden shift from 'doing' to 'being'. It's something that becomes easier the more you practice it, I suppose. Shifting your focus back onto your breathing helps when you find your mind wandering. When the two minutes were up, I came out feeling like I was 'gone' for longer than two minutes and felt a little bit disorientated! But it felt good to clear my head a bit and I'll definitely try practicing mindfulness on a more regular basis.</p>
