        <h2>Design-to-Web</h2>
        <h4>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h4>

        <p>Reponsive websites are websites that adapt their content to fit your device's screen size and resolution. This is so that the content makes optimal use of the space on the screen of whichever device you're accessing the website from. It is extremely important in this day and age in which screens range in size from 3.5 to 30+ inches, and users are accessing websites across a range of different devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, etc. Responsive design helps ensure that the user experience and website design language is consistent across all devices.</p>

        <h4>What is mobile-first design and why is it important?</h4>

        <p>As the name implies, mobile-first design is designing a website with the mobile layout in mind first and foremost. The rationale behind this is that it is simple to convert a mobile layout into a desktop layout because of the increased screen real estate. Designing a desktop site first, then attempting to convert it into a mobile layout is much more difficult as the designer has to work out how to cram all the webpage elements in a smaller form factor. The analogy of moving house is a good one to describe why mobile first design is important; it is very easy to move from a small apartment into a big house, but it is difficult to move from a large house with lots of furniture into a small apartment.</p>

        <h4>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h4>

        <p>Frameworks are standardised and free-to-use bit of code designed to be reused across many websites and web pages. Their purpose is generally to solve a common problem in web design (e.g. how to create a responsive site). For example, this website uses the Skeleton CSS framework for reponsive design. Skeleton is basically a stylesheet that tells the website how to look depending on the user's screen size. Instead of the developer needing to code it from scratch, they can simply use a framework like Skeleton as a starting point.</p>

        <p><i>Pros</i></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Time-savings</li>
          <li>Consistency</li>
          <li>Tidier code</li>
          <li>Reduced human error</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><i>Cons</i></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Prevents you from learning it yourself</li>
          <li>Your own customisations can potentially conflict with the framework, so it can therefore be quite limiting</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What are wireframes and why do we use them?</h4>

        <p>Wireframes are basic sketches of the bare-bones structure & layout of the website. They help the developer visualise what the final product will look like, without the need for actually coding it. The wireframes can then be translated into a  boxified design.</p>

        <h4>My wireframes</h4>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <p>My website design ended up deviating quite a bit from my initial wireframes. I struggled with creating a vertical navigation menu using the skeleton framework, and decided to do a horizontal menu instead. I will have a another go at creating a vertical navigation bar with drop-down menus over the next few weeks.</p>

        <h2>Udacity Reflection pt. 2</h2>
        <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>

        <p>Grid-based design is a way to split a webpage up into a an invisible grid in order to create the layout of the page more easily. A grid of any number of rows and 12 columns is common as it enables content on a page to be arranged in grids of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. If we use percentages to specify the size of the columns instead of pixels, the page can be resized more easily and accommodate a range of screens at different resolutions.</p>

        <h4>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>

        <p>More and more people are accessing the internet from mobile devices such as phones or tablets with a broad range of screen sizes and resolutions. When smartphones and tablets first came out, it was common to see separate mobile sites that would function a bit differently or not have as many features as desktop sites. Responsive design allows the user to view the same webpage across devices with the content adapting to fit the screen they are viewing it from. This enables a consistent user experience and design language across devices.</p>

        <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>

        <p>Semantic structure is defined by the conventions surrounding how programmers structure their HTML. While a browser might be able to read HTML that is on a single line, following semantic structure guidelines make it a lot more comphrehensible to humans. For example, a human would be able to look at an h1 tag and know that the content is most likely an important heading at the top of the page, whereas h2 or h3 text would most likely be sub-headings that are of lesser relative importance than the h1 tag.</p>

        <h4>Other thoughts</h4>

        <p>It was really cool seeing reponsive design in action on the Gizmodo (US) site by observing how the layout changes as you adjust the width of the browser window. Another page that I think does responsive design really well is the <a href="https://www.flickelectric.co.nz">Flick electric</a> website.</p>

        <h4>My CSS wishlist</h4>

        <p>Drop-down navigation menu</p>
        <p>Fixed position background images</p>
        <p>Shadows</p>
        <p>Embedded webfonts</p>
        <p>Multiple backgrounds</p>

        <h4>HTML, CSS, and the DOM: A non-technical analogy</h4>

        <p>I'm still trying to get my head around the concept of the DOM (Direct Object Model) and how it relates to HTML and CSS. If my understanding is correct, I think the different elements of a short story might make a good analogy for how they interrelate:</p>
        <p>HTML elements are like the subjects and objects in a short story (i.e. all the nouns). Without them the story doesn't really exist.</p>
        <p>CSS can be likened to the descriptive words used (i.e. adjectives, adverbs) to give the story character and bring it to life.</p>
        <p>(If I understood correctly) the DOM is kind of like the reader's understanding of language. Much like how we use our knowledge to determine which words are subjects/objects, and which are descriptive words, our web browsers use the DOM read and interpret nodes on a webpage.</p>

        <h4>What is boxifying design?</h4>

        <p>Boxifying design is the process of taking a design mockup and creating a very basic 'wireframe' of the webpage layout by physically or mentally drawing boxes around the different elements & sections of the page.</p>

        <h4>What is the Box Model?</h4>

        <p>The box model is a design rule that describes each element of a webpage as a box (regardless of its actual shape). The box is made up of several visible and invisible layers; the margin, the border, the padding, and the content itself.</p>
