    <h4>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h4>

    <p>I view EDA as a course that challenges more traditional teaching and learning philosophies where, instead of simply being told what to learn and do, students are encouraged to take control of what/how they learn the material.</p>

    <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>

    <p>My initial impressions are really positive! So far, my learning has been really practical and 'hands-on'. I am able learn the material at a speed at which I am comfortable, using the helpful resources provided by EDA as well as other resources I have found independently.</p>

    <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>

    <p>Really well, I hope! Part of what attracted me to EDA was their focus on teaching soft skills, as well as allowing students the freedom to learn the material in a way that best suits their learning style. I see a lot of similarities between the way EDA is structured and the Montessori teaching pedagogy (which I am very familiar with as a former Montessori student). I see myself engaging the EDA culture really well, and look forward to what the next 18 weeks will bring!</p>

    <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>

    <p>My expectations have definitely changed a little bit now that we have actually started. I was initially concerned that I might struggle to keep up with the material and was worried that it might be too technical for me to grasp. But the so far the way the course has been structured (with a number of assignments and smaller sub-tasks within the assignments) has meant that even if I might not complete a task in one sitting, I can still walk away feeling like I've accomplished something. It's also comforting to know that everyone else in my cohort is in the same boat as me, so if I'm struggling with something, chances are that someone else is struggling with it too.</p>

    <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>

    <p>As I mentioned before, I was intially pretty nervous about what to expect, but now that we have actually gotten stuck into it a little bit my nerves have setttled a bit!</p>
