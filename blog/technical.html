        <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>

        <p>Grid-based design is a way to split a webpage up into a an invisible grid in order to create the layout of the page more easily. A grid of any number of rows and 12 columns is common as it enables content on a page to be arranged in grids of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. If we use percentages to specify the size of the columns instead of pixels, the page can be resized more easily and accommodate a range of screens at different resolutions.</p>

        <h4>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>

        <p>More and more people are accessing the internet from mobile devices such as phones or tablets with a broad range of screen sizes and resolutions. When smartphones and tablets first came out, it was common to see separate mobile sites that would function a bit differently or not have as many features as desktop sites. Responsive design allows the user to view the same webpage across devices with the content adapting to fit the screen they are viewing it from. This enables a consistent user experience and design language across devices.</p>

        <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>

        <p>Semantic structure is defined by the conventions surrounding how programmers structure their HTML. While a browser might be able to read HTML that is on a single line, following semantic structure guidelines make it a lot more comphrehensible to humans. For example, a human would be able to look at an h1 tag and know that the content is most likely an important heading at the top of the page, whereas h2 or h3 text would most likely be sub-headings that are of lesser relative importance than the h1 tag.</p>

        <h4>Other thoughts</h4>

        <p>It was really cool seeing reponsive design in action on the Gizmodo (US) site by observing how the layout changes as you adjust the width of the browser window. Another page that I think does responsive design really well is the <a href="https://www.flickelectric.co.nz">Flick electric</a> website.</p>

        <h4>HTML, CSS, and the DOM: A non-technical analogy</h4>

        <p>I'm still trying to get my head around the concept of the DOM (Direct Object Model) and how it relates to HTML and CSS. If my understanding is correct, I think the different elements of a short story might make a good analogy for how they interrelate:</p>
        <p>HTML elements are like the subjects and objects in a short story (i.e. all the nouns). Without them the story doesn't really exist.</p>
        <p>CSS can be likened to the descriptive words used (i.e. adjectives, adverbs) to give the story character and bring it to life.</p>
        <p>(If I understood correctly) the DOM is kind of like the reader's understanding of language. Much like how we use our knowledge to determine which words are subjects/objects, and which are decriptive words, our web browsers use the DOM read and interpret nodes on a webpage.</p>

        <h4>What is boxifying design?</h4>

        <p>Boxifying design is the process of taking a design mockup and creating a very basic 'wireframe' of the webpage layout by physically or mentally drawing boxes around the different elements & sections of the page.</p>

        <h4>What is the Box Model?</h4>

        <p>The box model is a design rule that describes each element of a webpage as a box (regardless of its actual shape). The box is made up of several visible and invisible layers; the margin, the border, the padding, and the content itself.</p>
