    <h2>Time & Habits reflection</h2>

    <br>

    <p>After reading through the resources on time management and developing good habits, I found the blog post on <a href="https://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/">counterintuitive ways to be productive</a> really interesting because of how much it challenged my understanding of what it means to be 'productive'. I always considered productivity to mean being able to accomplish a lot of tasks in any given day, but the post describes it more as a state of mental well-being. In other words, the work we do is only productive if it is meaningful to us and makes us feel good at the end of the day. I also like that the author writes about how the things that we do aren't always productive, but that doesn't mean they're not important</p>

    <p>Although in the past I haven't really consciously thought about what techniques I use to be productive, I can see some parallels between what I just read about time & habits and what has worked for me in the past when working on a project. For example, <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/make-it-big-by-starting-small">starting small</a> is a technique that I have used subconsciously when working on big projects like university assignments. I find that the task doesn't seem as dauting when you're only looking at small pieces at a time. However, it can be easy to put too much energy into one small part if you have a good <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-best-tricks-for-getting-in-the-zone-at-work">flow</a> going. I believe this is where timeboxing comes into play.</p>

    <p>I see myself working on integrating <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/timebox.html">timeboxing</a> techniques into my work habits, as this will allow me to focus and, more importantly, de-focus on tasks in a more evenly distributed way. Toggl, the time-tracking tool used at EDA, has an in-built pomodoro timer feature which I will try out to see if it works for me. I also anticipate that myself and the teams I work with will be using the concept of <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html">Minimum Viable Product</a> a lot throughout our EDA journey.</p>
