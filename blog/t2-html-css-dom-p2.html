      <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>

      <p>Grid-based design is a way to split a webpage up into a an invisible grid in order to create the layout of the page more easily. A grid of any number of rows and 12 columns is common as it enables content on a page to be arranged in grids of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. If we use percentages to specify the size of the columns instead of pixels, the page can be resized more easily and accommodate a range of screens at different resolutions.</p>

      <h4>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>

      <p>More and more people are accessing the internet from mobile devices such as phones or tablets with a broad range of screen sizes and resolutions. When smartphones and tablets first came out, it was common to see separate mobile sites that would function a bit differently or not have as many features as desktop sites. Responsive design allows the user to view the same webpage across devices with the content adapting to fit the screen they are viewing it from. This enables a consistent user experience and design language across devices.</p>

      <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>

      <p>Semantic structure is defined by the conventions surrounding how programmers structure their HTML. While a browser might be able to read HTML that is on a single line, following semantic structure guidelines make it a lot more comphrehensible to humans. For example, a human would be able to look at an h1 tag and know that the content is most likely an important heading at the top of the page, whereas h2 or h3 text would most likely be sub-headings that are of lesser relative importance than the h1 tag.</p>

      <h4>Other thoughts</h4>

      <p>It was really cool seeing reponsive design in action on the Gizmodo (US) site by observing how the layout changes as you adjust the width of the browser window. Another page that I think does responsive design really well is the <a href="https://www.flickelectric.co.nz">Flick electric</a> website.</p>
