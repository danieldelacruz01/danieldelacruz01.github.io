        <h2>Javascript Projects</h2>

        <h4>What was your experience extending the racer game?</h4>

        <p>
          I found this one of the most challenging assignments in Phase-0. The features I wanted to implement were very ambitious, and I wasn't able to add everything I wanted in less than 6 hours. It was a little bit frustrating leaving it unfinished. I wasn't really able to utilise much of my existing code because the features I was adding were pretty drastically different.
        </p>

        <h4>Did you learn anything about building the calculator?</h4>

        <p>
          I was amazed at how far I've come since I started in November. I was able to complete the project much quicker than I had anticipated, building the core functionality of my calculator in about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. One thing I have observed is that I tend to spend a lot more time making my projects look nice using CSS than I do actually building them with HTML and Javascript.

        <h2>Testing</h2>

        <h4>Explain to your non-tech friend</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Scope:</b> You use scope to set which functions have access to which variables and how long they are valid for. In JavaScript, there two scopes (global and local). Local variables are variables which are declared within JS functions and are therefore only accessible within those functions. The variable becomes invalid once the function has finished running. On the other hand, global variables are declared outside of functions and can be accessed and modified by all functions in the code. The variable stays valid as long as the page is open.</li>
          <li><b>Parentheses ():</b> Parentheses are used to hold arguments when calling functions. They can also be used to set the order of operations, just like in algebra.</li>
          <li><b>Braces {}:</b> The curly braces are used to set the start and end of of a function. When the function is called, all code within the braces will run.</li>
          <li><b>Square brackets []:</b> Square brackets are used to contain or access values of an array. An array allows you to store multiple values in a single variable by using sqaure brackets and separating each value with a comma. (e.g. var myArray = [0,1,2,3,4,5] ). You can also use square brackets to access individual values in the array (e.g. myArray[0] returns the first value in the array).</li>
          <li><b>Single quotes ' ' and double quotes " " :</b> Both single quotes and double quotes are used to contain strings (e.g. "My name is Daniel"). Either of them are acceptable, although you need to be careful not to include the same type of quotes within quotes (i.e. "His name is "Johnny"" will be shortened to "His name is ", but "His name is 'Johnny'" will work fine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Problem-Solving Techniques and Processes</h2>

        <h4>About a time I got blocked on a simple problem</h4>

        <p>In the Javascript Udacity course, I was having difficulty appending the map to my resume page. It was very frustrating, because my code looked exactly like the instructor's, so was unable to figure out what the problem. I ended up turning to our cohort's Slack channel to find out if anyone else was experiencing a similar problem. It was then brought to my attention that all I needed to do was uncomment the section related to the map in the HTML document! Looking back, it seems like an obvious solution to a simple problem, but I learnt a valuable lesson from it; while the code that I'm working on might not contain any errors, there may be code in an external file that is causing an error.</p>

        <h4>About a time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h4>

        <p>For my Javascript Racer game, I was having trouble figuring out how to map an individual key to a keyup event. I was able to solve the problem using Google, and a combination of 'Trying something' and console.logging for testing how it worked. From this process, I discovered how useful console.logging can be when it comes to testing not just whether your code works, but learning about how it works too.</p>

        <h4>My confidence in using the following problem-solving techniques:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Psuedocode:</b> I definitely need to practice this a bit more. I can see how it helps you understand the logical progression of the code without worrying about syntax just yet.</li>
          <li><b>Trying something:</b> I use this all the time, with mixed results. It can be really helpful to simply try something out and see what it returns.</li>
          <li><b>Rubber ducky method:</b> I haven't gotten myself a rubber ducky yet, but I have used a similar method with a peer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about talking to inanimate objects!</li>
          <li><b>Reading error messages:</b> Although I haven't understood some of the error messages that I have come across so far, I have found it helpful to use error messages to find out which line of code in particular is causing the problem.</li>
          <li><b>Console.logging:</b> So far, this method has been really handy for finding out what values my code is outputting.</li>
          <li><b>Googling:</b> This is pretty much my go-to technique for solving any problem I come across, not just in programming, but other areas as well. I honestly can't image how people used to solve probems in their code before Google!</li>
          <li><b>Asking your peers for help:</b> I have both helped and received help from my peers in the cohort. This is n excellent method for problem solving, since we're all working through the same problems. Chances are, if I got stuck on something, there is someone else who also got stuck on it and can help me out. It can also be comforting to now that I'm not the only one having trouble with certain tasks!</li>
          <li><b>Asking coaches for help:</b> I haven't tried this yet, I view this as kind of a last resort when all else fails.</li>
          <li><b>Improving your process with reflection:</b> I find that reflecting on the problems I have come across and how I solved them helps me better retain what I have learnt.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Explain to your non-tech friend</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><b>.map():</b> This allows you to create a new array using a function that is called on each item of an existing array. For example if you had an array of numbers, you could create a function that multiplies the value by two, then use .map() to create a new array that doubles each value in the exisitng array by calling the multiply function on each item within it.</li>
          <li><b>.filter():</b> this allows you to test all items in an array aginst a condition, and create a new array that returns all items that either meet or don't meet that condition. A practical application for this could be filtering all items in an online shop above a certian price.</li>
          <li><b>.reduce():</b> I still don't fully grasp how .reduce() works, but from what I understand it reduces all the values in an array to into just one value. For example, you would use this if you wanted to return the sum of all numbers in an array. It does this but adding the first two items in the array together, then adding the output to the next item in the array until it reaches the end.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Recursion vs Iteration</h4>

        <p>Both recursion and iteration are used to repeat functions over and over, but they do so in a slightly different ways. Iteration is basically just a loop of the same function over and over again, whereas recursion is like a nesting function that calls itself (kind of like function-inception!). <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyHloXKnPWc">This explanation</a> uses factorials as an example of recursion (i.e. x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)... until 1 is reached).</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <h4>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML is used to establish the structural elements (or content) of a webpage. It tells the browser which elements are headings, which elements are paragraphs, which elements are images, for example.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS defines how the HTML elements look on the webpage. For example, you might use CSS to tell the browser that paragraphs should be displayed in a certain typeface like Arial, or that images should have yellow borders.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript is used to create functions that alter the way a site looks and behaves in response to user inputs. For example, you would use JavaScript to create a menu that drops down in response to you clicking on it, or hovering your mouse over it. JS essentially makes the website more interactive.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h4>

        <p>Control flow and loops are used to determine the order in which a program runs its code. They include statements like 'if (this condition is met) {perform this action} else {perform this action}' or 'while (this condition is true) {perform this action}'. We actually use similar control flow and loops in our own everyday lives. For example, when deciding whether or not to take a pizza out of the oven, you might think to yourself 'if (pizza = hot) {remove from oven} else {leave in oven}.</p>

        <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>

        <p>Both arrays and objects are used to store data, but the ways they are stored, accessed, and edited are very different. Arrays are useful for data that can be stored in an ordered list. For example, storing the results of a horse race from first place to last place. Objects allow you to store and access your data in a more methodical way. Consider Netflix as an example. It would be a nightmare to have every single film and TV show on Netflix in one long list. It makes a lot more sense to split them into categories of 'movies' and 'TV shows'. You could then create subacategories according to genre, like 'comedy', 'drama', 'action', etc. Objects store data (and arrays of data) in a similar way.</p>

        <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>

        <p>A function is like a snippet of code that can be used and re-used as many times as you like using different parameters. For example, say you wanted to multiply two numbers together. You could create a function called 'multiply' that uses X and Y as parameters, and runs some code that multiplies X and Y together. This is how it would look:</p>

        <p>var multiply = function (X, Y) { <br> console.log (X * Y); <br>}</p>

        <p>Then, when you run the function by entering something like 'multiply (4, 5)', the console would multiply the two parameters together and display the answer (20)</p>

        <p>Functions are useful because you can re-use them as many times as you like, so you don't have to write the code you would like to execute out manually every time.</p>

        <h2>Design-to-Web</h2>
        <h4>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h4>

        <p>Reponsive websites are websites that adapt their content to fit your device's screen size and resolution. This is so that the content makes optimal use of the space on the screen of whichever device you're accessing the website from. It is extremely important in this day and age in which screens range in size from 3.5 to 30+ inches, and users are accessing websites across a range of different devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, etc. Responsive design helps ensure that the user experience and website design language is consistent across all devices.</p>

        <h4>What is mobile-first design and why is it important?</h4>

        <p>As the name implies, mobile-first design is designing a website with the mobile layout in mind first and foremost. The rationale behind this is that it is simple to convert a mobile layout into a desktop layout because of the increased screen real estate. Designing a desktop site first, then attempting to convert it into a mobile layout is much more difficult as the designer has to work out how to cram all the webpage elements in a smaller form factor. The analogy of moving house is a good one to describe why mobile first design is important; it is very easy to move from a small apartment into a big house, but it is difficult to move from a large house with lots of furniture into a small apartment.</p>

        <h4>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h4>

        <p>Frameworks are standardised and free-to-use bit of code designed to be reused across many websites and web pages. Their purpose is generally to solve a common problem in web design (e.g. how to create a responsive site). For example, this website uses the Skeleton CSS framework for reponsive design. Skeleton is basically a stylesheet that tells the website how to look depending on the user's screen size. Instead of the developer needing to code it from scratch, they can simply use a framework like Skeleton as a starting point.</p>

        <p><i>Pros</i></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Time-savings</li>
          <li>Consistency</li>
          <li>Tidier code</li>
          <li>Reduced human error</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><i>Cons</i></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Prevents you from learning it yourself</li>
          <li>Your own customisations can potentially conflict with the framework, so it can therefore be quite limiting</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What are wireframes and why do we use them?</h4>

        <p>Wireframes are basic sketches of the bare-bones structure & layout of the website. They help the developer visualise what the final product will look like, without the need for actually coding it. The wireframes can then be translated into a  boxified design.</p>

        <h4>My wireframes</h4>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <a href="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </a>

        <p>My website design ended up deviating quite a bit from my initial wireframes. I struggled with creating a vertical navigation menu using the skeleton framework, and decided to do a horizontal menu instead. I will have a another go at creating a vertical navigation bar with drop-down menus over the next few weeks.</p>

        <h2>Udacity Reflection pt. 2</h2>
        <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>

        <p>Grid-based design is a way to split a webpage up into a an invisible grid in order to create the layout of the page more easily. A grid of any number of rows and 12 columns is common as it enables content on a page to be arranged in grids of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. If we use percentages to specify the size of the columns instead of pixels, the page can be resized more easily and accommodate a range of screens at different resolutions.</p>

        <h4>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>

        <p>More and more people are accessing the internet from mobile devices such as phones or tablets with a broad range of screen sizes and resolutions. When smartphones and tablets first came out, it was common to see separate mobile sites that would function a bit differently or not have as many features as desktop sites. Responsive design allows the user to view the same webpage across devices with the content adapting to fit the screen they are viewing it from. This enables a consistent user experience and design language across devices.</p>

        <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>

        <p>Semantic structure is defined by the conventions surrounding how programmers structure their HTML. While a browser might be able to read HTML that is on a single line, following semantic structure guidelines make it a lot more comphrehensible to humans. For example, a human would be able to look at an h1 tag and know that the content is most likely an important heading at the top of the page, whereas h2 or h3 text would most likely be sub-headings that are of lesser relative importance than the h1 tag.</p>

        <h4>Other thoughts</h4>

        <p>It was really cool seeing reponsive design in action on the Gizmodo (US) site by observing how the layout changes as you adjust the width of the browser window. Another page that I think does responsive design really well is the <a href="https://www.flickelectric.co.nz">Flick electric</a> website.</p>

        <p>Shadows</p>
        <p>Embedded webfonts</p>
        <p>Multiple backgrounds</p>

        <h4>HTML, CSS, and the DOM: A non-technical analogy</h4>

        <p>I'm still trying to get my head around the concept of the DOM (Direct Object Model) and how it relates to HTML and CSS. If my understanding is correct, I think the different elements of a short story might make a good analogy for how they interrelate:</p>
        <p>HTML elements are like the subjects and objects in a short story (i.e. all the nouns). Without them the story doesn't really exist.</p>
        <p>CSS can be likened to the descriptive words used (i.e. adjectives, adverbs) to give the story character and bring it to life.</p>
        <p>(If I understood correctly) the DOM is kind of like the reader's understanding of language. Much like how we use our knowledge to determine which words are subjects/objects, and which are descriptive words, our web browsers use the DOM read and interpret nodes on a webpage.</p>

        <h4>What is boxifying design?</h4>

        <p>Boxifying design is the process of taking a design mockup and creating a very basic 'wireframe' of the webpage layout by physically or mentally drawing boxes around the different elements & sections of the page.</p>

        <h4>What is the Box Model?</h4>

        <p>The box model is a design rule that describes each element of a webpage as a box (regardless of its actual shape). The box is made up of several visible and invisible layers; the margin, the border, the padding, and the content itself.</p>
